# World of Cagiu

Cagiu stands for Caged Girl Universe and is a fantasy/horror roleplaying website. It was born around my dark, gothic music. I've been neglected this project for way too long, and it is over a year old, born in 2022/2023 but is still a prototype unfortunately... But I'm looking forward to work on it more now!
