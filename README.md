# World of Cagiu

Cagiu stands for Caged Girl Universe and is a fantasy/horror roleplaying website. It was born around my dark, gothic music. I've neglected this project for way too long, and it is over a year old, born in 2022/2023 but is still a prototype, unfortunately... But I'm looking forward to working on it more now! Read more about the concept on the link below.
